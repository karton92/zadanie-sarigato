6. Create funcionality helping add all cards.
7. Working with filter functionality.
8. Working with sort functions - here was the worst moment - I try switch solution with 2 value and multiple case (case "something" && "something" etc) but after hours of reading why this doesn't work I decided to use if...
9. It's look to work but there was some bugs. I try fix all bugs.
10. When sort function was fine I work with functions formating stats.
11. Look for reg ex for format subscribers, video, views count and create functions.
12. Finaly add format functions to channelCard.
